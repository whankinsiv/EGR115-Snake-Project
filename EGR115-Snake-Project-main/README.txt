Directions: The game represented in our final project is Snake. The game is simple and there is technically no "winning", 
but the player may strive to get high scores, as the game saves high scores every time it is ran in a seperate file.
"Losing" is determined as when the user either hits themselves ('='), or hits the walls that are identified by '#'.
To play the game, simply run the snake_script m-File, and when the figure window pops up, click 'a' to start the game.
As the snake starts moving, the control keys are as follows: a - left, w - up, s - down, d - right, and q - quit. 

Implemented Feature: The feature added was the 'gcf' tool. The tool was used to get the current character that the user
pressed in the figure window at any time without use of the command window. We also then used annotation text boxes in the figure window to display our 'map' and decided coloring for the background.
